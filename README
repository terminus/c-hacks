A repository for small, hopefully not useless hacks.  Mostly low level in
nature because, well, layers of abstraction suck :).

Current contents:
  tsc-drift: measure drift between tsc (timestamp registers on x86) across
  	cores/processors. This uses a rather neat lockless synchronization
	algorithm (stolen shamelessly from linux kernel.)
